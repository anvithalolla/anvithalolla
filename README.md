# üëã About Me

I am a **Cybersecurity Engineer** with a focus on application security, cloud security, and security automation. My work has involved:

‚úî Developing end-to-end IoT security architecture for smart inhalers adhering to HIPAA, NIST, and ISO standards  
‚úî Conducting in-depth threat modeling using STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks  
‚úî Automating security testing by integrating SAST and DAST tools in CI/CD pipelines  
‚úî Implementing IAM solutions with RBAC for 200+ users  

Beyond application security, I have technical expertise in penetration testing, vulnerability management, and security monitoring. My experience spans across various tools including **Semgrep**, **BurpSuite**, **OWASP ZAP**, **MobSF**, and cloud platforms like **AWS** and **Azure**.

As organizations shift toward cloud-native and IoT environments, security cannot remain static. It needs to evolve. That's why I've expanded my technical expertise, ensuring that security is not just implemented but actively enforced through automation and integration within DevSecOps workflows.

I am looking to apply my cybersecurity expertise in a security-driven organization while leveraging automation to make security more scalable, efficient, and proactive.
